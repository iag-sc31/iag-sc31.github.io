### Topics
The Topics that are relevant to the Earth Tides and Geodynamics Commission take into account geodynamic phenomena on different temporal and spatial scales. These geodynamic phenomena can be observed by modern instrumentation and monitoring systems, both terrestrial and space-borne. The seminars will be open for a wide range of scientific problems in geodynamics research. Interactions of geophysical fluids with Earth tides phenomena and observations are a specific focus and includes:

- Tidal and non-tidal loading in space geodetic and subsurface observations
- Permanent and dynamic effects of Earth tides on the geodetic reference system
- Using tides and ocean tidal loading with modern geodesy to probe Earth structure
- Variations in Earth rotation, gravity field and geocenter due to mass redistributions
- Tidal forcing of plate movement
- Subsurface fluid movement through geodetic and gravity observation
- Fluid pressure changes due to Earth tides
- Stress and deformation changes due to injected fluids
- Earth tides, mass movements and deformation at volcanoes
- Tidal effects on geodetic satellites as GOCE, GRACE, â€¦
- Innovations in instrumentation for gravity and deformation observation
- Innovations in software, data analyses and prediction methods of loading and tides
- Induced seismicity
- Tides and geodynamics in planets
